# miren sandbox exec

Open interactive shell in an existing sandbox

This command connects to an existing sandbox and runs a command inside it. Unlike `miren app run` which creates a new ephemeral sandbox, this connects to a sandbox that's already running (typically one serving production traffic).

## Finding Sandbox IDs

Use `miren sandbox list` to find the ID of a running sandbox:

```bash
$ miren sandbox list
ID                          APP       SERVICE   STATUS    NODE
sandbox/myapp-web-abc123    myapp     web       RUNNING   node-1
sandbox/myapp-web-def456    myapp     web       RUNNING   node-2
```

:::warning
When you exec into a production sandbox, you're connecting to a live instance that may be serving traffic. Be careful with commands that could affect the running application.
:::

:::tip
For debugging or one-off tasks without affecting production, use `miren app run` to create an isolated ephemeral sandbox instead.
