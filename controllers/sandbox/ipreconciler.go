// IPReconciler keeps the netdb IP lease bookkeeping in agreement with the
// addresses actually live on the bridge. The two can diverge — a release path
// that ran while a container kept running, a lease lost across a restart — and a
// divergence where netdb believes a live address is free leads to that address
// being handed to a second sandbox, a duplicate assignment (MIR-1238).
//
// Each cycle it:
//   - re-reserves any address that is live on the bridge but not reserved in
//     netdb (the repair direction — always safe, only ever adds a reservation
//     for an address already in use); and
//   - releases any address reserved in netdb with no live owner, but only after
//     it has been absent for several consecutive cycles (the reap direction —
//     conservative, to avoid racing a sandbox that is mid-create or mid-teardown).
